This is an Introduction to pyhton exercises i did and uploaded to check my progress.
its basically some small programs to keep me going and as they say its the small wins that count.
consistency is very keep so will keep pushing myself til i become very kowledeageble about the python program and can build apps and website and eveerything that i an think of 
Hopefully hoping on landing a job with this skill.
